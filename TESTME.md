    -   ### script.js
![Results after adjustments were made](/readme/testing/script-jshint-warning.png)

When I put my JavaScript through JS Hint to validate my coding there were the following warnings and errors found:

-   38 warnings which included - missing semicolons, unnecessary semicolons, let and const is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6) or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).
-   2 undefined variables - global variable declared but not used and an internal variable declared and not used.
-   2 functions used - function to show that the user was elegible for the next year and function declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics (currentYear, yearQuestions, startGame) on line 316.

By adding these notes (/* jshint esversion: 6 */, /* jshint -W033 */) at the top of the script file, the missing semicolons, let and const warning were removed. The warnings and erros were deleted as were not necessary to the running of the function. The function above was left in, as it was not causing a problem and was being used within the game.
